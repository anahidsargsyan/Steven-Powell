								<h3>Hennepin County Medical Center</h3>
								<p>This 462 bed medical center provides the healthcare for the indigent in Hennepin County in downtown Minneapolis.  It is a Level 1 trauma center with several centers of excellence and is ranked as one of the best hospitals by U.S. News & World Report.  However, the medical center is currently faced with an accumulation of high maintenance older buildings and declining revenues.  The leadership wanted to address these issues and embrace the requirements of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) by developing a master plan that reaches out into the suburbs to take healthcare where the patients live.  This strategy was to help develop additional revenues in the suburbs to fund the mission downtown.<br><br>

								I was the senior medical planner for the master planning of both the existing downtown campus and the proposed suburban outpatient surgery and clinics building.  This master planning process was largely driven by both the appropriate distribution of the existing surgical caseload between the downtown and suburban campuses and the determination of the correct number of operating rooms.  First, I teased out the number of outpatient procedures from the existing combined surgical caseload numbers.  Second, I loaded these caseload numbers into the Demand Model that I developed.  The result was the correct number of operating rooms downtown and in the suburbs that were then loaded into the space program.</p>

								<h3>Jaber Al-Ahmed Al Jaber Al-Sabah Hospital</h3>
								<p>This 1,200 bed and 700,000 square meter hospital for the Kuwait, Ministry of Health, which when completed will be the largest hospital in the State ofKuwait and one of the largest in the Arabic Gulf. It was the pet project of the late Amir and bears his name.<br><br>
								I was the designer and senior medical planner through design development
								in association with another senior Los Angeles architect. We designed it on
								13 levels above grade and gave it a center by pulling the inpatient tower
								away form the D&T block, which created a large medical mall capped by a
								crescent shaped skylight.<br><br>
								Beyond the size, it is also notable for the Emergency Department that I
								based on the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center. This design
								provides for a continuum of care from the Emergency Department through
								the ICU. Sets of ICUs were segregated from the other ICUs and are
								dedicated to and located directly above the Emergency Department and the
								Emergency Operating Rooms.</p>

								<h3>California Prison Receivership (CPR)</h3>
								<p>This 5,000 bed and 800,000 square foot project was located on seven
								individual sites across California and is one of the largest design-build
								projects in the state. It was paid for by the State of California and managed
								by the Federal Courts Receiver, who is a personal champion of IPD and
								Lean design. Some of the nations best known contractors and architects
								were teamed up to develop cost effective designs for the replacement of the
								existing state prison hospital system. For most of 2010 we worked together
								full time in a single IPD design studio in Sacramento.<br><br>
								The teams were tasked to reduce the initial staffing and construction costs
								of the project by a third through Lean processes. I was the senior medical
								planner who developed and managed the project space program used by
								the teams, which the staffing and cost models were based on. I led the
								process and value stream mapping workshops where Lean processes were
								used. I was able to eliminate the redundant areas that subsequently
								reduced the program area by the required one third.</p>

								<h3>Lucile Packard Children's Hospital</h3>
								<p>This 200 bed and 530,000 square foot hospital is associated with and is
								being constructed on the Stanford University Medical Center campus. It is
								one of the nation’s best-known childrens hospitals with six Centers of
								Excellence and is ranked #10 by U.S. News & World Report.<br><br>
								I was the senior medical planner for the initial design of this children’s
								hospital with another medical planner while Kohn Pedersen Fox were the
								design architects. Also, I was on the redesign with the same medical
								planner when Perkins+ Will in San Francisco replaced KPF as the design
								architects.</p>

								<h3>Riverside County Regional Medical Center</h3>
								<p>The RCRMC Emergency Department sees over 120,000 patients per year,
								and at peak hours patients are typically being treated on folding chairs in the
								corridors. The hospital leadership wanted better for their existing patients
								because they would soon be able to choose other facilities due to the
								Affordable Care Act (ACA). Furthermore, the leadership wanted to attract
								new patients with private insurance. Through visioning sessions, we
								developed the “First choice, not last resort” principle for the new Emergency
								Department.<br><br>
								I was the senior medical planner for the design of this project and I
								developed a Lean design that delivered more for less. I, with a Lean
								healthcare consultant, led a series of process and value stream mapping
								workshops where we eliminated both redundant steps and the associated
								areas. Additionally, I designed Treatment Bays that could swing from single
								to double occupancy during peak hours to maximize throughput. When
								completed, the new ED will eliminate overcrowding, retain existing patients,
								and attract privately insured patients because it will be the premier
								Emergency Department in the region.</p>

								<h3>John Hopkins Hospital</h3>
								<p>This 560 bed and 1.6 million square foot children’s and adult hospital is
								associated with and on the Johns Hopkins University Medical Center
								campus. The design has twin towers on a shared D&T block with one
								tower dedicated to children with the other to adults. It is one of the nation’s
								best-known hospitals with several Centers of Excellence and is ranked #1
								by U.S. News & World Report.<br><br>
								I developed concept department designs after the project was first
								awarded. Subsequently, I was the senior medical planner who created the
								standardized detailed design of the Surgical Department for the Design
								Development Submittal. I revised all 33 surgical suites to include the
								specific placement of all equipment and the coordination of mechanical,
								electrical, data and plumbing requirements for the entire department.
								Lastly, I located all equipment and coordinated mechanical, electrical, data
								and plumbing requirements for the double Hybrid ORs with shared MRI
								imaging.</p>
